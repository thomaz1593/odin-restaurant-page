          <p class="about-text">
            At Fork Overflow, we believe that food, like code, should be
            well-structured, clean, and full of flavor. Founded by a team of
            foodies who are just as passionate about debugging as they are about
            dining, we set out to create a restaurant that blends our love for
            coding with our obsession for great food.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Our kitchen runs on the principle of "agile" cooking, where every
            dish is a sprint towards culinary perfection. We’ve forked the best
            ingredients, merged them into delightful meals, and deployed them to
            your plate without any delays or glitches. Whether you’re here for a
            quick "hotfix" or a full "release," our menu will leave you
            satisfied and hungry for more!
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            At Fork Overflow, we celebrate creativity, innovation, and a dash of
            humor. Our dishes are built with care, ensuring they scale well with

            endless loops here—just fresh, delicious, and dependable food that
            always gets the job done.
